# PunkEmotesHotkeys

Adds a simple hotkey to the backslash `\` key to play a configurable emote. Use your mod manager's edit config option after you have launched the game at least once (to let the default config generate) to edit what emote is played. Requires PunkEmotes since it uses the `em` command to send the emote.

## Todo:

Add more hotkeys or maybe a hotkey menu with slick UI, I dunno
